# Software Engineering Project: Around The U.S.

This began as the Sprint 3 Project for TripleTen Software Engineering Practicum, focused on adaptive web design and working with design layouts. It has been migrated for continued work in Sprint 4, which introduces the use of JavaScript. The elements should all display correctly on popular screen sizes, with 1280px given for the desktop view and 320px given for the mobile view. Transitions between these sizes are made to be smooth and readable.
